# javascript-clicker-attempt
### Also shall be known as "Budget Clicker" to whom it may concern.

Welcome to "javascript clicker attempt" or, formally, "Budget Clicker"
This is a version I can actually maintain while seeking my education, and is easier to manage.

# Source
This project is open source, meaning anyone could download it, and change it to their liking, as it is being hosted with Github. 

# How to play on broswer???
**Check the website link that was listed, or use [this one](https://s1887204.github.io/javascript-clicker-attempt/)**

# How was it built???
This was made with HTML and a bunch of CSS magic. The CSS file literally carries this entire project visually.
It's currently just one HTML file which is small, a chunky CSS file, and a **BEEFY** JS file which runs all of this magic beautiful-ness

# Controls???
To save, its CTRL + S, like any clicker game. It should also auto-save every 30 seconds if you want to be patient.
You can also reset your progress with CTRL + Q in case your game breaks, which if it does, report the issue in the ISSUES tab here and use Inspect Console to see what happened

# Current Status???
### Demo, currently being maintained as of January 29, 2025. Check website for recent uploads.

# Hosting??
You are welcome to host the game on your own websites and such, just give credit, thanks.
